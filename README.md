# WeatherApp

Using the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for various cities, I've constructed a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

The user searches for a city, and is presented with the current weather forecast, as well as a five day future forecast for that city; that city is then added to the search history.

The information includes the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.

Further, it not only displays the chosen city's UV index, but the index is color-coded to indicate whether the conditions are favorable (green), moderate (yellow or orange), or severe (red).
